# Micro-IT-Internship-PASSWORD GENERATOR USING PYTHON :

Password Generator in Python
This Python program generates secure, random passwords based on user-specified criteria. It allows the user to define the desired length of the password and whether to include different types of characters such as:

Lowercase letters (a-z)

Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Digits (0-9)

Special symbols (e.g., !@#$%^&*())

The program uses Python's built-in random module to ensure the randomness of the password, which helps enhance security by making it difficult to predict or guess the generated password.

FEATURES:

Customizable password length

Option to include or exclude different character types

Generates passwords that are strong and unpredictable

Easy to use and modify for various security needs

EXAMPLE USE CASE:
This tool is perfect for creating strong passwords for user accounts, Wi-Fi networks, or any service that requires secure authentication.
